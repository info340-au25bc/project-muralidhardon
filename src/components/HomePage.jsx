      <h2>Welcome to Husky Flashcards</h2>
      <p>
        Husky Flashcards helps UW students review concepts for common classes like CSE 312, INFO 340,
        ACCTG 219, and more. Create structured decks and quiz yourself on key ideas.
      </p>

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a deck from the Decks page.</li>
        <li>Flip through the questions and reveal answers when you are ready.</li>
        <li>Use multiple passes to move cards from “confusing” to “confident.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why use this?</h3>
      <p>
        Flashcard practice supports spaced repetition and active recall. These powerful
        techniques enhance long-term retention, especially for mathy and conceptual courses.
