            <p>
                College students, especially those in information-dense fields such as medicine, computer science, and language learning, must memorize and retain vast amounts of material. However, it can be difficult to produce effective study methods. Re-reading notes, passive review, or cramming before exams can lead to poor long-term retention and overall wasted study time. Research in cognitive psychology has proven that studying through active recall and spaced repetition (reviewing material at increasing intervals) can dramatically improve memory retention. The common saying to "study smart, not hard," is an important piece of advice that students struggle to execute without proper tools.

                Current digital flashcard platforms attempt to address this problem, but have significant flaws. <a href="https://quizlet.com">Quizlet</a>, the most commonly used flashcard app, offers basic card-flipping functionality but lacks intelligent scheduling algorithms to optimize review timing. Students end up reviewing cards they already know while neglecting difficult material. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> provides powerful spaced repetition capabilities, but its outdated interface and steep learning curve discourage adoption among casual users. Both platforms also fail to facilitate meaningful collaboration, making it difficult for students to easily share notes, study together in real-time, or view their collective progress. The core problem becomes how we can make evidence-based study techniques accessible and intuitive while facilitating collaboration between students.
